# Potato Leaf Disease Detection

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect and classify diseases in potato leaves. By analyzing leaf images, the system identifies common diseases such as blight, mosaic, and yellowing. The tool helps in early disease detection, improving crop management and yield predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for model development and deployment.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization, including plotting training results.
- **PyTorch & TensorFlow**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API for easy model building.
- **Jupyter**: Interactive notebook used for data exploration and model training.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications to showcase the model.

## Features
- Classifies diseases in potato leaves using image-based machine learning models.
- Visualizes data and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Allows user-friendly, real-time disease prediction via a Streamlit interface.
- Supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch models for flexibility in model training.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/potato-leaf-disease-detection.git
   cd potato-leaf-disease-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   The `requirements.txt` includes libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Streamlit, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Usage

1. **Start the Streamlit app:**
   Run the following command to start the web interface:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   This will launch a web page where you can upload potato leaf images and receive disease predictions.

2. **Jupyter Notebooks:**
   You can also explore the data and train the models interactively using Jupyter notebooks. To start Jupyter, run:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
